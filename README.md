# MLOpsSync: End-to-End ML System with Cloud Deployment

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **complete MLOps pipeline** featuring **automated data processing, experiment tracking, and cloud deployment**. The system efficiently streamlines **machine learning workflows** by integrating MLflow for tracking and GitHub Actions for **CI/CD automation**, ultimately deploying models to **AWS EC2**.

### üöÄ Features
- **Automated Data Processing:** Custom pipeline for ingestion, validation, and transformation.
- **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow integration for model versioning and hyperparameter tracking.
- **Modular Project Structure:** Template-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated deployment via **GitHub Actions**.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Hosted on **AWS EC2** for production-ready usage.
- **API Endpoints:** Flask-based REST API for model inference.
- **Containerized Application:** Packaged using **Docker** for portability.
